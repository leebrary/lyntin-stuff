A Crystal Hallway
  A stark crystal hallway leads north-south here.  Looking into the deep
shadows to the north, you realize it would probably be an unwise idea to
venture any further in that direction, though south, with all the dead,
seems to be hardly a more amiable direction.  

[ Exits: north south ]
A rusalka haunts the river bed, seeking to lure you to death.
A gwrach y rhibyn spreads her wings and howls.
The muryans haunt this world, waiting for the end.
An ahuitzotl picks its teeth with a bone of its last victim.
A cyroeraeth stands at the crossroads, wailing your death.

Death's Throne Room
  You stand in Death's Throne Room, the throne itself a solid block of
diamond covered with crimson hangings.  The air is filled with the scents of
incense, and a faint tinge of music can be heard.  The ceiling is lost in
shadows, and the Lady who rules here is shadowed herself, making you wonder
if there really is anyone sitting upon her throne.

entirely by a crystal sculpture.  What the sculpture once was, you cannot

  This crystal hallway beguiles the eyes with tantalizing shades of every
color imaginable.  You're not sure if the color comes from the strong
sunlight shining through the crystal, or from the surrounding rooms that
seem to echo every shade.

Syntax: fire

Lulled by the promise of a hot meal, some hearty tunes and that life-
giving warmth, the Fire skill will enable a character to rest and sleep
more effectively. It costs 100 moves to build a fire, and due to the
fact that firewood is sometimes sparse, they can only be built in wood,
hill or mountainous areas.

Syntax: dual <weapon name>
        dual remove

Physical classes can learn to wield a secondary weapon in their off-hand,
which can be used for an extra attack on opponents.  Due to the skill
required to use this ability, the second weapon must be half the weight of
the first (or less), and there is no room to use a shield or hold other
objects while using two weapons.  Dexterity and luck, combined with weapon
and dual wielding proficiency, will determine how many hits your secondary
weapon will get.

Soldiers ignore weapon weights when dual wielding.

In Aylor, there is a place where you can have your weapon weights halved

[ Paging : (Enter), (T)op, (Q)uit, (B)ack, (R)efresh, (L)ast, (A)ll ]: h dual

and doubled. See 'help tpspend' for more details.  Some legends say weapons
can be balanced and feel so light that the pair are interchangeable.

'second' and 'offhand' are synonymous with 'dual'.  You can remove any item
in the dual wield slot using the syntax 'dual remove'.  Using dual will
automatically remove held/shield items.

Instinct Bonus: The potential to increase total number of hits.  (See
'help instinct').

In the Tower of Strength (G)
  The common room of the Warriors' Guild takes up the majority of the
ground floor of the Tower of Strength, though some space is taken up by
private rooms for lesser guild officers.  Noted soldiers and knights can
often be found here telling the stories of their exploits and bragging of
the princesses they've saved.  Some of the warriors in the tower are here to
offer training and the benefit of their experience, while others simply drop
by for company or a place to sleep before moving on.  The walls are lined
with tapestries and "guarded" by suits of display armor.  Ample light spills
in through the windows during the day, while wall sconces hold torches to
keep the common room cozy at night.  At the northernmost end of the hall a
grand staircase leads to the upper levels of the tower.

Syntax: dual <weapon name>
        dual remove

Physical classes can learn to wield a secondary weapon in their off-hand,
which can be used for an extra attack on opponents.  Due to the skill
required to use this ability, the second weapon must be half the weight of
the first (or less), and there is no room to use a shield or hold other
objects while using two weapons.  Dexterity and luck, combined with weapon
and dual wielding proficiency, will determine how many hits your secondary
weapon will get.

Soldiers ignore weapon weights when dual wielding.

In Aylor, there is a place where you can have your weapon weights halved

[ Paging : (Enter), (T)op, (Q)uit, (B)ack, (R)efresh, (L)ast, (A)ll ]: help dual

and doubled. See 'help tpspend' for more details.  Some legends say weapons
can be balanced and feel so light that the pair are interchangeable.

'second' and 'offhand' are synonymous with 'dual'.  You can remove any item
in the dual wield slot using the syntax 'dual remove'.  Using dual will
automatically remove held/shield items.

Instinct Bonus: The potential to increase total number of hits.  (See
'help instinct').

She is speaking with a troll who is testing the feel of a blade in his hand.
Many daggers, swords, flails, and maces sit in racks all neatly organized
for customer access.  A trellis covers this platform, supported by beams
based at each of the four corners.  Various staves and polearms are
suspended from the trellis by large hooks.  A ramp to the north will take
you to a higher platform, while the eastern ramp takes you to a lower one.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  You stand before a towering gate, the walls lined with crystal statues of
famous heroes.  Or are those statues?  The eyes move and follow you in a
disturbing way, and you seem to hear a faint screaming above the wind.

A Winding Road
  A long, winding road leads past the gate to a large manor.  From this
distance the manor seems to be made out of crystal...  But who would live in
a crystal house?

In the Doorway
  You stand in the doorway of a manor that is, indeed, made out of crystal.
The only hint of color is a deep crimson that bleeds through the facets of
the walls and splashes everything with an aura of blood.

A Stairway
  You stand at the foot of a long stairway heading upwards.  The crystal
steps float almost invisibly, and you wonder how difficult it will be to
find your footing on these stairs.  But, as they say, nothing ventured,
nothing gained...

The Top of the Stairs
  You stand at the top of the eastern staircase, wondering how you will
get back down it.  Shards of bone and dried blood indicate that many do not
make it down these steps without injury.  The sun shines brightly through
the crystal, casting back reflections into your eyes, making your chances of
getting down them even slimmer.

  You walk along an unused hallway in the manor, the air filled with a
chill that you're sure isn't from the air outside.  The distant moans of the
dead penetrate even this deep into the manor, making you glad you're not
among them.

A Dusty Corridor
  This corridor is evidently not used very often, except for perhaps the
dead.  You bless this fact, as the dust makes your footing easier and the
chances much less likely that you'll trip and hurt yourself.  That doesn't
speak for anything else hurting you, of course.

  You stand at the top of the eastern staircase, wondering how you will

A Servant's Room
  The dust in this room has been disturbed recently, though by what you're
not entirely sure you want to know.  The sun catches glints of crystal
shining beneath the tracked dust at your feet, and though your ears strain
to catch any sound, nothing can be heard.

A crystal chime sounds, summoning back the dead.

Hourglass Room
  You stand in a room filled with hourglasses of all types, shapes and
sizes.  Drawing closer to them you notice that each hourglass has a name on
it.  You wonder if, somewhere deep in the gloomy caverns of this room,
there's one with your name, but feel that it would be a mistake to go
looking for it...
