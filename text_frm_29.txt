The Slave's Square
  You are in one of the most oppressed regions of the Underdark.  It is here
that the capitalist dream has become totally realised.  The oppression and
repression of those who should be free is evident in everything that stands
in this square.  Stocks to hold the bad slaves, a guillotine to kill the slaves
that stand up for their rights.  The slaves are reduced to animals in this
square.
 
To the north is the Slaver's Route, east and south lies the square.

The Slave's Square
  You are in the northeast corner the slave's square.  The name is a cruel
slavers joke, they have given the slaves this square.  The square is the only
thing the slaves have, and it is used for their maiming, sentencing and
execution.  The ground is clean, with dark brown spots here and there. 
The dark brown stains are stains of blood.
 
North is the Slaver's Route, west and south lies the slave's square.

Syntax: Enrage

The key to any Barbarian's true power is focused anger.  The anger flowing
through an enraged Barbarian allows them to hit nearly twice as hard with 
weapons as others engaged in combat for a short period of time.  

The downside of this, however, is that little focus is left for opponents' 
reactions, thus causing an additional amount of damage to be taken in combat 
as well. Additionally, hand to hand attacks are not influenced by enrage,
only weapon attacks.

This ability stacks with berserk/frenzy and with someone else under the
same affect (double damage dealt, then damage doubled again).  It is not
usable with any other Rage ability.

Slaver's Route, Before the Brothel
  The Slaver's Route, almost everyone in the Underdark has walked along
these famous stones.  It was along this road that the city was made. 
Without the slave trade, the city would not have expanded as fast as it did
when the city was first built.  The Underdark has since become a trade
centre where those who dwell beneath the ground and those above can
interact in relative safety.
 
To the north is the Brothel , east and west the Slaver's Route.

worn down by the feet of the enslaved and imprisoned.  To the west you

the way for you.

Sunrise
  You stand on Sunrise the eastern most street in the Underdark.  The street
name is a joke on those surface dwellers who may crave the sun.  Sunrise
travels along the eastern cavern wall.  The Underdark is a huge city
compared to Midgaard.  The city that was founded has grown to fill the
cavern and thrives in the dark.  Over half the people who live here can see
in the dark, the floating orbs were placed for the surface dwellers so they
could kinda see.

North is the eastern entrance, south Sunrise continues.

Sunrise, Before the Cages
  You are walking along Sunrise, a clean and broad street.  Small floating
orbs light the way, casting a surrealistic haze all around you.  The
sounds of the city bounce off the cavern wall to the east and find their way
into your ears.  The smell of sweat engages your nose.  A dark forbidding
thought enters your head, the shadows begin to come alive.  Always, just out of
your sight, a shape flits in and out of the shadows. 
 
North and west Sunrise goes on.  South is the entrance to the cages.

to realise that there really is little of note on it.  The street is dark, and
dirty.  The only good thing about this little alley is the fact that the hum of
the city has died down.

The alley continues east and west.

Forgotten Alley
  You are walking down the Forgotten Alley.  The only sounds that reach you
are the soft murmurs of people talking in quiet voices.  Darkness surrounds
you and the floating orbs are spaced ever twenty feet here.  The orb above
you flickers in and out chaotically.

The alley continues east and west.

Entrance to Eurandus' Home
  You stand in the foyer of this large mansion that is in the most dangerous
part of town.  The first thing you notice is that fact that it is kept dark in
here.  The walls are dull and the floor is dusty.  Yet you hear some noises
of habitation.  What type of man is Eurandus?

The way out is east, a hall goes north.

  You are standing on a dark walkway before a huge house.  It is this house

To the east is the Forgotten Alley, west is a door.

  You are walking down the east side of the Underdark.  This huge dark city
hides all sorts of criminal activity.  But at the surface, the city is calm, no
fighting on the streets.  The only reason there is no fighting is that fact that
huge guardian eyes float through the city preventing open fights.  Glowing
orbs float in the air, casting their dim glow on all around.  Illuminating
basically nothing but giving some light.

You can make out very few features of the city here.  Only the muffled
agonized cries and the hum of thousands talking indicate that this is a huge

now is about 2 times larger than Midgaard.  This is the meeting place of
the rogues and thieves from the world of sun and moon and those who
dwell beneath the earth.

Sunrise, Before the Cages
  You are walking along Sunrise, a clean and broad street.  Small floating
orbs light the way, casting a surrealistic haze all around you.  The
sounds of the city bounce off the cavern wall to the east and find their way
into your ears.  The smell of sweat engages your nose.  A dark forbidding
thought enters your head, the shadows begin to come alive.  Always, just out of
your sight, a shape flits in and out of the shadows. 
 
North and west Sunrise goes on.  South is the entrance to the cages.

Sunrise
  You stand on Sunrise the eastern most street in the Underdark.  The street
name is a joke on those surface dwellers who may crave the sun.  Sunrise
travels along the eastern cavern wall.  The Underdark is a huge city
compared to Midgaard.  The city that was founded has grown to fill the
cavern and thrives in the dark.  Over half the people who live here can see
in the dark, the floating orbs were placed for the surface dwellers so they
could kinda see.

North is the eastern entrance, south Sunrise continues.

Before the East Entrance (G)
  You stand just at the east entrance to the Underdark.  Before you looms a
huge cavern, or so you think, since you can't tell with your eyes.  Darkness
is everywhere, there is a layer of light that has been formed by a series of
floating orbs that rest above your head.  Above this layer of light, darkness
lies.  It is because of this that you think you stand in a huge cavern.  The
air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people, but also agonized screams.  The shadows seem to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark. 
 
The north and south is Sunrise, to the east is the entrance and to the west is
the Slaver's Route and farther down, the market area.

The Slave's Square
  You are in one of the most oppressed regions of the Underdark.  It is here
that the capitalist dream has become totally realised.  The oppression and
repression of those who should be free is evident in everything that stands
in this square.  Stocks to hold the bad slaves, a guillotine to kill the slaves
that stand up for their rights.  The slaves are reduced to animals in this
square.
 
To the north is the Slaver's Route, east and south lies the square.

ground has dark brown stains on it.  The cruel reality of slavery can be felt
by your soul, causing it to ache to own and manipulate other beings.  You
can realise this desire to the west.

Street of the Gods, Etaine
  You stand at the beginning of the Street of the Gods, this street has been
dedicated to the many gods of different realms of mud.  The road here has
been polished and the glowing orbs seem to glow a little bit brighter here. 
Although different then having a temple in the city to worship the gods in,
the gods have come to accept the street.
 
To the south is the Road of Shadows, north the street continues.

Road of Shadows
  You travel down the Road of Shadows.  There is nothing that you can see
clearly through the veil of darkness.  Everything is covered by a blanket of
grey, the lighting is that of being in a shadow.  The darkness here seems to
be so thick that even the noise of the city does not penetrate it.  To the
north, the darkness clears up considerably.
 
North is the beginning of the Street of Gods.  East and west the Road of
Shadows stretches onwards.

A cutpurse moves silently through the shadows.
(Hidden) A drow murderer blends into the shadows watching for an opening.

Road of Shadows
  You walk along this dark and gloomy road.  The shadows seem to live and
breed here, they cover everything and get stronger in every crack. 
Glowing orbs float above you but shed no light, just more shadows it
seems.  Everything seems to be black, grey and white.  Colour does not
exist on this road.
 
The Road of Shadows continues east and west.

Road of Shadows
  You stand on the Road of Shadows.  This road clearly takes it name by the
simple fact that everything is covered by shadows.  Even the floating orbs
seems to radiate not light, but the grey of shadows.  Along this street,
everything loses its colour and becomes black and white.
 
The Road of Shadows continues east and west.

Road of Shadows
  You stand at the beginning of the Road of Shadows.  Darkness surrounds
you and all your equipment.  Everything has a shadow, including your light
source.  It's as if you left the world and came to a place where colour and
light does not exist.  Nothing has colour, just a different shade of grey.
 
The Road of Shadows travels west.  East and south is Sunrise.

Sunrise
  You are walking down Sunrise.  Glowing orbs light the way into dimness. 
You can make out very few features of the city here.  Only the muffled
agonized cries and the hum of thousands talking indicate that this is a huge
city.  Built in the recent past, the city has undergone major growth and
now is about 2 times larger than Midgaard.  This is the meeting place of
the rogues and thieves from the world of sun and moon and those who
dwell beneath the earth.

Sunrise continues east and west.

Sunrise, Before the Cages
  You are walking along Sunrise, a clean and broad street.  Small floating
orbs light the way, casting a surrealistic haze all around you.  The
sounds of the city bounce off the cavern wall to the east and find their way
into your ears.  The smell of sweat engages your nose.  A dark forbidding
thought enters your head, the shadows begin to come alive.  Always, just out of
your sight, a shape flits in and out of the shadows. 
 
North and west Sunrise goes on.  South is the entrance to the cages.

Sunrise
  You stand on Sunrise the eastern most street in the Underdark.  The street
name is a joke on those surface dwellers who may crave the sun.  Sunrise
travels along the eastern cavern wall.  The Underdark is a huge city
compared to Midgaard.  The city that was founded has grown to fill the
cavern and thrives in the dark.  Over half the people who live here can see
in the dark, the floating orbs were placed for the surface dwellers so they
could kinda see.

North is the eastern entrance, south Sunrise continues.

Before the East Entrance (G)
  You stand just at the east entrance to the Underdark.  Before you looms a
huge cavern, or so you think, since you can't tell with your eyes.  Darkness
is everywhere, there is a layer of light that has been formed by a series of
floating orbs that rest above your head.  Above this layer of light, darkness
lies.  It is because of this that you think you stand in a huge cavern.  The
air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people, but also agonized screams.  The shadows seem to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark. 
 
The north and south is Sunrise, to the east is the entrance and to the west is
the Slaver's Route and farther down, the market area.

  You stand on Sunrise, the eastern most street of the Underdark.  The street
stretches to the north.  Glowing orbs float above your head every ten feet. 
Even with the orbs, darkness seems to eat the light with an appetite.  The
air is moist and warm.  The smells of the city strike your nose as
repugnant.

standing side by side here.  The floor has levelled off and has been worn
smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks.  You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals its surface
counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a
series of markings that you can't make out at this distance.  A huge door
stands to the west, the way to the surface is up.

Vast Corridor
  You are walking through a huge corridor, the corridor that connects the
Underdark to the surface.  You can feel a breeze coming from above you. 
The walls are basically black to your eyes.  The only light comes from
your light source.
 
The corridor continues down and up.

Vast Corridor
  This is a huge corridor with room for ten humans to walk side by side. 
The walls are a very deep dark grey, with the north wall being even darker
than the south wall.  The floor has been worn down by the feet of the
oppressed.  This is the way the slavers take their slaves from the surface
world.

The corridor continues down and up.

  You are walking down through a huge corridor.  The walls are dark grey. 
The floor of the corridor has been worn down by the feet of many.  You
are walking along the path that connects the Underdark to the surface

The corridor heads up and down.

Mountains Near the Ocean
  Shadows dart between the thick trunks of the pine and spruce which grow
thickly on the mountain sides.  Sounds of wildlife seem to surround the
area; a mountain goat's hooves clattering on stones, a small chittering,
perhaps a chipmunk frightened from its burrow, even a rustling, a sound like
that of a foraging bear.  The scent of salt water carries on in the chill
air, and the sounds of the ocean crashing against the very foot of the
mountains come from the north.  Nearly all light is blocked by the branches
of the trees, and while the trees themselves also block most of the wind,
there is enough whispering among the thick trunks to carry an icy mist
through the dim shadows.  There are fewer trees to the east, which makes it
easy to climb out of the mountains into low rolling hills.  Further east,
just visible on the horizon, the ocean meets the sky.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

In the Tower of Strength (G)
  The common room of the Warriors' Guild takes up the majority of the
ground floor of the Tower of Strength, though some space is taken up by
private rooms for lesser guild officers.  Noted soldiers and knights can
often be found here telling the stories of their exploits and bragging of
the princesses they've saved.  Some of the warriors in the tower are here to
offer training and the benefit of their experience, while others simply drop
by for company or a place to sleep before moving on.  The walls are lined
with tapestries and "guarded" by suits of display armor.  Ample light spills
in through the windows during the day, while wall sconces hold torches to
keep the common room cozy at night.  At the northernmost end of the hall a
grand staircase leads to the upper levels of the tower.

Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best 
fighters of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the 
magical talents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't 
mind taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called 
for.  Warriors begin with skill in the sword. The warrior's primary stat is 
STRENGTH.

The most important stats for a warrior are STR (damage), CON (armor
value) and DEX (number of hits).

Warrior Subclasses:

   Barbarian
   Soldier
   Blacksmith

Special skills/spells available to characters with the warrior 
primary class:

   Shield block               Fortitude
   Fifth attack               Sixth attack

Syntax:
  train                        - Shows current stat costs/totals.
  train <stat>                 - increases given stat one point.
  train <amount> <stat>        - increases given stat multiple points.
  train cost <amount> <stat>   - check cost to train multiple points.
  train convert|convertall     - Changes practices into train(s).
  train practices|reconvertall - Changes train(s) into practices.

You will gain training sessions as you level, as well as from other sources
(such as goal, campaign, or sometimes quest rewards).  These are used to
increase your stats via the 'train' command at a trainer or guildmaster.
There are several trainers in Aylor; see 'help find' to get directions.

Before training stats for the first time, it is strongly recommended that
you read 'help stats'.  You may also want to check out the help file for
your class (i.e., 'help mage') for suggested stats to train.

[ Paging : (Enter), (T)op, (Q)uit, (B)ack, (R)efresh, (L)ast, (A)ll ]: h convert


If you have the training sessions available (see Training Costs, below),
you may increase a stat by one point by simply typing 'train <stat>'.  You
may also increase a stat by more than one point by using 'train <amount>
<stat>'.  To see how many trains it would cost to increase a stat a certain
amount, use 'train cost <amount> <stat>'.

You may also convert 10 practices into a training session by using the
syntax 'train convert'.  To convert a training session into 10 practices,
use 'train practices' or 'gain reconvert'.  You may also use 'train
reconvertall' to convert all trains into practices, or 'train convertall'
to convert as many sets of 10 practices into trains.

'Train' with no arguments will show trained stats, costs, and maximums.
'Gain', which was used in V2 and prior, is still available as an alias for
'train'.


Training Costs and Limits

As your stats increase, it will eventually cost more than one train to
increase a stat by one point.  This cost is primarily influenced by your

race (the 'Train Costs' line in 'help <racename>' or shown via the 
raceinfo command (see 'help raceinfo')).  Unlike most game mechanics, a
negative modifier is better, reducing the number of trains it costs to add
one point in that stat.

Training costs can also be reduced through tiering and the statcost wish;
see 'help tierstat' for more information.

There is also a cap for the number of points you can train in a single stat
and across all stats, based upon level.  The eventual maximum trainable cap
for stats is 400 points in a single stat at level 200/201.  Reaching these
stat caps takes a lot of work, but is not essential to make progress in the
game.

Because later stat increases cost many trains, it is advisable to NOT train
hit points, mana, or moves until you have reached stat caps at level 200/
201.

See 'help maxstats' for more information on train costs and stat caps.


Adjusting Stats- Forget and Rebuild

[ Paging : (Enter), (T)op, (Q)uit, (B)ack, (R)efresh, (L)ast, (A)ll ]: 


Sometimes when leveling, bonus stats may be awarded.  These bonuses may not
be desired, especially if it means hitting stat caps with desired stats not
at max.  The 'forget' command ('help forget') will remove stats and prevent
bonuses in that stat.

If your stats are completely not to your liking, you may reset your stats
and re-train them, often for a fee of some of the trains spent.  See 'help
rebuild' for more information.

Xena's Weapon Parlor
  Xena, Andolar's most famous weaponsmith, stands next to a large forge. 
She is speaking with a troll who is testing the feel of a blade in his hand.
Many daggers, swords, flails, and maces sit in racks all neatly organized
for customer access.  A trellis covers this platform, supported by beams
based at each of the four corners.  Various staves and polearms are
suspended from the trellis by large hooks.  A ramp to the north will take
you to a higher platform, while the eastern ramp takes you to a lower one.

In the Tower of Strength (G)
  The common room of the Warriors' Guild takes up the majority of the
ground floor of the Tower of Strength, though some space is taken up by
private rooms for lesser guild officers.  Noted soldiers and knights can
often be found here telling the stories of their exploits and bragging of
the princesses they've saved.  Some of the warriors in the tower are here to
offer training and the benefit of their experience, while others simply drop
by for company or a place to sleep before moving on.  The walls are lined
with tapestries and "guarded" by suits of display armor.  Ample light spills
in through the windows during the day, while wall sconces hold torches to
keep the common room cozy at night.  At the northernmost end of the hall a
grand staircase leads to the upper levels of the tower.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Before the entrance to the Underdark
  You stand before a huge door.  The corridor can easily fit fifteen humans
standing side by side here.  The floor has levelled off and has been worn
smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks.  You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals its surface
counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a
series of markings that you can't make out at this distance.  A huge door
stands to the west, the way to the surface is up.

Before the East Entrance (G)
  You stand just at the east entrance to the Underdark.  Before you looms a
huge cavern, or so you think, since you can't tell with your eyes.  Darkness
is everywhere, there is a layer of light that has been formed by a series of
floating orbs that rest above your head.  Above this layer of light, darkness
lies.  It is because of this that you think you stand in a huge cavern.  The
air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people, but also agonized screams.  The shadows seem to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark. 
 
The north and south is Sunrise, to the east is the entrance and to the west is
the Slaver's Route and farther down, the market area.

Syntax: Enrage

The key to any Barbarian's true power is focused anger.  The anger flowing
through an enraged Barbarian allows them to hit nearly twice as hard with 
weapons as others engaged in combat for a short period of time.  

The downside of this, however, is that little focus is left for opponents' 
reactions, thus causing an additional amount of damage to be taken in combat 
as well. Additionally, hand to hand attacks are not influenced by enrage,
only weapon attacks.

This ability stacks with berserk/frenzy and with someone else under the
same affect (double damage dealt, then damage doubled again).  It is not
usable with any other Rage ability.

Skill available only to the Barbarian Warrior Subclass.

The Slave's Square
  You are in one of the most oppressed regions of the Underdark.  It is here
that the capitalist dream has become totally realised.  The oppression and
repression of those who should be free is evident in everything that stands
in this square.  Stocks to hold the bad slaves, a guillotine to kill the slaves
that stand up for their rights.  The slaves are reduced to animals in this
square.
 
To the north is the Slaver's Route, east and south lies the square.

The Slave's Square
  You stand in the southwest corner of the slave's square.  Here you can
clearly hear the screams of slaves dying, from the past, the present and the
future.  Some twisted mage made it possible to hear these screams.  The
smell of decaying corpses reaches your nostrils every now and then.  The
ground has dark brown stains on it.  The cruel reality of slavery can be felt
by your soul, causing it to ache to own and manipulate other beings.  You
can realise this desire to the west.

Street of the Gods, RoX
  This section of the street has been dedicated to RoX.  The street is clean
and well built, no bugs in it.  Orbs float every ten feet, although the street
is clean, the shadows are darker than they should be and whisper of
assassins.  The lighting cast from the orbs is not white, it's cobalt blue. 
The screams of the city do not penetrate into this section.  On the ground
lie holy symbols of Farside, RoX's playground.
 
East and west the street continues, north is the slave's square and south is
the entrance to Shadow's Shadow (a tavern).

Prison Hall (G)
  You are walking down the prison hallway.  This is where the eyes bring
the ones who break their code of living.  You see no signs of struggle and
nothing is broken.  The eyes also make this building their home base and
you know that somewhere in it rests the enforcer beholder, the leader of
the eyes.

The hall continues north and south, prison cells lie east and west.

Slaver's Route
  You stand on the Slaver's Route, so named for the simple reason that the
slavers use this road to transport their merchandise.  The slavers in the
Underdark are renowned for their cruelty, you can tell that this rumour is
true by all the screams of pain and horror that seem to come from all
around you.  The shadows of the city seem to live and breed by
themselves.  Above your head are small floating orbs that bathe the street
with a dim light.
 
To the east is the eastern entrance, to the west, the Slaver's Route.

  You stand just at the east entrance to the Underdark.  Before you looms a
huge cavern, or so you think, since you can't tell with your eyes.  Darkness
is everywhere, there is a layer of light that has been formed by a series of
floating orbs that rest above your head.  Above this layer of light, darkness
lies.  It is because of this that you think you stand in a huge cavern.  The
air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people, but also agonized screams.  The shadows seem to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark. 
 
The north and south is Sunrise, to the east is the entrance and to the west is

Sunrise
  You stand on Sunrise, the eastern most street of the Underdark.  The street
stretches to the north.  Glowing orbs float above your head every ten feet. 
Even with the orbs, darkness seems to eat the light with an appetite.  The
air is moist and warm.  The smells of the city strike your nose as
repugnant.
 
Sunrise continues north, to the south is the Slaver's Route.

The denizens of the Underdark are ready to start their business.

Sunrise
  You stand on Sunrise, the eastern most street of the Underdark.  The street
stretches to the north.  Glowing orbs float above your head every ten feet. 
Even with the orbs, darkness seems to eat the light with an appetite.  The
air is moist and warm.  The smells of the city strike your nose as
repugnant.
 
Sunrise continues north, to the south is the Slaver's Route.

There is a loud scream and a flare of light shoots towards the sky.
Below the flare, you hear FairyTail scream 'HEAR ME, FOR I HAVE CONQUERED!'
As the light fades you realize a new superhero has been born.

Before the East Entrance (G)
  You stand just at the east entrance to the Underdark.  Before you looms a
huge cavern, or so you think, since you can't tell with your eyes.  Darkness
is everywhere, there is a layer of light that has been formed by a series of
floating orbs that rest above your head.  Above this layer of light, darkness
lies.  It is because of this that you think you stand in a huge cavern.  The
air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people, but also agonized screams.  The shadows seem to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark. 
 
The north and south is Sunrise, to the east is the entrance and to the west is
the Slaver's Route and farther down, the market area.

  You stand on the Slaver's Route, so named for the simple reason that the
slavers use this road to transport their merchandise.  The slavers in the
Underdark are renowned for their cruelty, you can tell that this rumour is
true by all the screams of pain and horror that seem to come from all
around you.  The shadows of the city seem to live and breed by
themselves.  Above your head are small floating orbs that bathe the street
with a dim light.

Street of the Gods, RoX
  This section of the street has been dedicated to RoX.  The street is clean
and well built, no bugs in it.  Orbs float every ten feet, although the street
is clean, the shadows are darker than they should be and whisper of
assassins.  The lighting cast from the orbs is not white, it's cobalt blue. 
The screams of the city do not penetrate into this section.  On the ground
lie holy symbols of Farside, RoX's playground.
 
East and west the street continues, north is the slave's square and south is
the entrance to Shadow's Shadow (a tavern).

The Slave's Square
  You are in one of the most oppressed regions of the Underdark.  It is here
that the capitalist dream has become totally realised.  The oppression and
repression of those who should be free is evident in everything that stands
in this square.  Stocks to hold the bad slaves, a guillotine to kill the slaves
that stand up for their rights.  The slaves are reduced to animals in this
square.
 
To the north is the Slaver's Route, east and south lies the square.

Slaver's Route
  You stand on the western side of the business area of the Underdark.  The
hum of people buying, selling and trading is overwhelming.  Everywhere you
look you see people.  Above your head, the floating orbs generate their soft
light to basically illuminate everything.

To the east and west the route goes on.  To the south is gathering space,
and to the north is a door to a home.

The Gathering Place
  You are in the northwest corner of the gathering place.  It is here that the
denizens of the Underdark come to meet to discuss business.  The lighting
here is dimmer than in most places.  Dark shapes seem to blend in and out
of the shadows.  Somehow the sounds of the city do not invade this place
so it is quiet enough to discuss without shouting.  The square is basically
clear but the dimness makes it impossible to see farther than 10 feet, thus
making it perfect for meetings of a discrete manner.  It seems as if some
orbs have stopped working.
 
North is the Slaver's Route, the gathering place continues east and south.

  You stand in the southwest corner of the gathering place.  All around you
the air seems to be distorted, sounds that should be close sound far away. 
Shapes have no tangible form.  Some mage spent a lot of time setting up
this area for discrete meetings.
 
North and east the gathering place goes on.  South is the Street of the Gods.

The Gathering Place
  You stand at the northeast corner of the gathering place.  Around you is a
mist that seems to come from nothing.  The mist limits your vision to
about 7 feet in any direction.  The only sounds that reach you ears are
muffled and distorted making it impossible to understand them.  Dark
forms wander at the edge of your vision, you can't tell if it your
imagination or reality.
 
North is the Slaver's route, west and south the gathering place continues.

The Gathering Place
  You are in the northwest corner of the gathering place.  It is here that the
denizens of the Underdark come to meet to discuss business.  The lighting
here is dimmer than in most places.  Dark shapes seem to blend in and out
of the shadows.  Somehow the sounds of the city do not invade this place
so it is quiet enough to discuss without shouting.  The square is basically
clear but the dimness makes it impossible to see farther than 10 feet, thus
making it perfect for meetings of a discrete manner.  It seems as if some
orbs have stopped working.
 
North is the Slaver's Route, the gathering place continues east and south.

only light is cast by the lights creatures carry and the glowing orbs that

  Sunset is a road that is very well travelled.  Glowing orbs float in the air
every ten feet lighting your path.  Although the orbs light most of the
street, off to the side the street remains shrouded in black. 

Sunset continues north and south.
